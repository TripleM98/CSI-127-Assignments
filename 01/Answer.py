#This program will print out the letter "i" 10 times. The while loop will cause
#the program to repeat the letter "i" as many times as it wants to as long as "i"
#is less than 12. The % symbol in the if statement will evaluate the remainder of
#the result. In this case, when "i"=12, then 12 % 12 will give a remainder of 0.
#This will cause the program to stop printing "i". "i"="i"+1 is a counter to the
#while loop. If the counter wasn't there, then the program will print out "i"
#infinitely.
